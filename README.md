# CodeLearningPathwayFrameworkObject
The goal of this repo is to provide 10 simple programs that, by stepping through and completing allow you to learn a programming language to a basic level.

# Intended pathway
1. **Hello world**, Teaching you how to compile and provide basic output
2. **Calculator**, Teaching you to collect user input and use math operations
3. **FizzBuzz**, If statements and loops
4. **Read/write from file**, Saving and opening data from a file
5. **Execute linux command**, Running a linux command, not all code works in isolation
6. **Hashing and encryption**, Hashing and encrypting, can include sorting and random
7. **Download from website and make get requests**, The start of a working with the web
8. **Something unique/weird**, learn the intricasies of the language
9. **GUI**, making something visual
10. **Basic Game**, Core deliverable. Using an existing game ruleset makes the design/ideation stage easier and provides a clear requirements to a project.
